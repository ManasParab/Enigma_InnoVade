## 📝 Problem Statement
**Current chronic disease management platforms are reactive data silos.**  
Patients face fatigue from endless manual logging, while clinicians are overwhelmed with unfiltered data, leading to alert fatigue and missed interventions. Patients are left without predictive support until a crisis occurs.  

**Objective:**  
Build a **web-based predictive ecosystem** that co-manages chronic conditions, leveraging:  
- **AI to anticipate risks**  
- **Behavioral nudges to sustain engagement**  
- **Community support to empower patients and clinicians**  

---

## 🚀 Core Features
- **Predictive Risk Engine** – AI-driven "Stability Score" forecasting potential health risks.  
- **Context-Aware Nudges** – Personalized prompts to support lifestyle balance.  
- **Progress Dashboard** – Visual trendlines for vitals, habits, and adherence.
